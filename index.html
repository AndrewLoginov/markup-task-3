                <p class="news_p">One day a black horseman came to a Texas ranch with a
                    black stallion. He appealed to the local blacksmith Dukkan with a request to shoe.</p>
                <h3 class="news_h3 first_news_caption">But his request was very unusual:
                    he asked to shoe not his horse, but himself</h3>
                <p class="news_p">The old blacksmith immediately realized that we were
                    dealing with the "unclean" himself. He took the longest nails and
                    began to nail horseshoes. Every nail has caused the devil such
                    suffering that he pleaded for mercy. Then Dukkan took a bullet
                    from him to never enter the house where a horseshoe hangs above the door.</p>
                <h3 class="news_h3">Ever since, horseshoe is considered a symbol of

                Indians had little reason to love white people. The "pale-faced"
                drove the Redskins from their lands, providing in exchange fruitless
                reservations. White hunters ruthlessly exterminated the buffalo, the
                hunt for which was for many tribes the main source of food. For the
                warlike Indians of the West, war seemed the easiest and most natural
                way to end the “white threat”. The Indians did not realize how unequal
                the forces were. Each tribe was in contact with a very limited number
                of “pale faces”, and few Indians visited cities on the Atlantic coast.
                The number of American soldiers who participated in the wars with the
                Indians has also always been very small. As a result, the Indians were
                inclined to downplay the total number of white people, considering them
                to be a relatively small, albeit very powerful tribe. Therefore, even
                small Indian tribes often declared war on the United States, counting
                on a favorable outcome for themselves. The American government seized
                upon every opportunity to rid the western lands of their native inhabitants,
                which caused so much inconvenience to the white settlers. Most whites were
                in complete agreement with General Sheridan’s statement in the epigraph of
                this chapter.</p><br>

            <p class="second_news_text news_p_second">Thus, wars between whites and Indians
                were inevitable. In 1862, the troops of Colonel Christopher "Whale" Carson
                attacked the Apaches in their reservations. This war continued intermittently
                until 1886, when the Apaches finally ceased resistance, and their leader
                Geronimo surrendered to captivity. Keith Carson, acting together with the
                Utah Indians, campaigned against the Navajo. He burned the Navajo settlements
                and stole their livestock. Somewhat later, he failed to defeat the combined
                forces of the Kiowa, Cheyenne and Comanche in the battle of Edowie Walls.
                Colonel Carson was killed by the Indians in 1868. The most successful war
                for the Indians was the Red Cloud War, named after the Lakota leader.
                According to the peace treaty in Fort Larami in 1868, the Lakota
                received a huge reservation, in the territory of which there should
                not have been American troops, settlements and roads. American soldiers,
                having at their disposal only 53 warriors. After gold was discovered on
                the Lakota reservation territory, the contract at Fort Laramie turned
                into an empty piece of paper. Numerous violations of this agreement by
                whites forced the Indians in 1876 to re-enter the warpath. In the first
                major battle of Little Bighorn, the combined forces of the Lakota and
                Cheyennes, commanded by the leaders of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse,
                defeated the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the US Army. The hero of the Civil
                War, commanded by American troops, General George Custer was surrounded
                with a small detachment of his soldiers during the battle and was killed
                in battle. The American cavalrymen lost more than 300 people killed and
                wounded, the Indians a little less.</p>

            <h2 class="news_h3">Drying Creek</h2>
            <p class="news_p_second">Cowboy is the name used in the Wild West of
                the United States in relation to herdsmen. The era of cowboys began
                in 1865, when it was necessary to drive into the hijackings of the
                gigantic wild herds of bulls, mainly in the territory of Texas.
                This era ended about twenty years later. After the 1930s, a nostalgic,
                glorifying look at cowboys became fashionable in America. He is
                reflected in the musical style of country music, comics, advertising,
                clothing, as well as in cinema. The indispensable attributes of a
                cowboy are cowboy hat, boots, vest, plaid shirt with double yoke,
                a lasso, a revolver A lot was among the representatives of this
                profession and the Mexicans.A lot was among the representatives

            <p class="news_p_second">The best shooter in the Cowboys could not
                shoot two pistols at once. First, at the time of the cowboys,
                two revolvers were worn at once, either eccentric people, or
                novices, or Texas riders and military men. Secondly, no one shot
                at the same time from two Colts, preferring to make twelve accurate
                shots without reloading first from one pistol, and then from
                the other.</p>

            <p class="news_p_second">Cowboys constantly organized shootouts in
                homes and in saloons. This is fiction. It should be remembered
                that in those days gunpowder was used, which, when burned,
                emitted a large amount of smoke. So, the very first shot filled
                the room with a suffocating black cloud, and the coughing arrows
                were forced to leave the smoky building as soon as possible.</p>

                the rodeo the winners were not only “white”. For example,
                Net Love, well managed with a lasso, and John Ouar, who had
